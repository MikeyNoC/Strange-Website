  <h3>You will need four items for the ritual; a box of matches, a salt shaker, a candle, and a non-digital clock. The clock can be two minutes slow or fast, but no more or less. You must start the ritual at 11:55, the clock must show the time 11:57, 11:53, or somewhere in between, no more or less. When you have everything ready, you may begin the ritual.</h3>
  <p> 1)  Sit down on the floor cross legged, it is easier if you sit down on a flat surface.</p>
  <p> 2)  Place the clock in front of you facing away, then place the candle between you and the clock.</p>
  <p> 3)  Light the candle using only one match, only one, and count to seven.</p>
  <p> 4)  Use the salt shaker to form an almost perfect circle around you, leaving a gap in the direction of the candle. (If you are right-handed then hold the salt shaker in your left hand, if you are left-handed then hold it in your right hand.)</p>
  <p> 5)  Close your eyes, name your sins, and say your full name. (Do not lie about your sins, name <b>all</b> of them. Do not use any nicknames or initials, you <b>must</b> use your <b>full</b> name.)</p>
  <p> 6)  Without opening your eyes, blow out the candle. Your tries to blow out the candle are limited to the number of sins that you named. (Do not open your eyes until you have blown the same amount as your sins.)</p>
  <p> 7)  Open your eyes, if the candle is still lit, then you have failed the ritual, but if it is blown out, then you may continue. (Do not attempt to try the ritual again on the same night, you <b>must</b> wait one year before you can try again.)</p>
  <p> 8)  Pick up the candle and use it to wipe the salt into a pile in front of you, do not worry about all of it, just try to get most of it.</p>
  <p> 9)  Place the candle on top of the pile of salt, if you are having difficulty, then make a small circle with the salt to support the candle. (Do not use your hands to make the circle, use the candle.)</p>
  <p> 10) Light the candle one last time, using only one match, and let the candle melt onto the salt.</p>
  <p> 11) Turn the clock so that it is facing you, if it has been less than 7 minutes since you started the ritual, then you may continue on with your daily life, but if it has been more than 7 minutes, then you must stay in that spot until 6:00. (You can read a book if you want, just do not leave that spot.)</p>
  <h4>Congratulations, you have completed the Sin Removal Ritual, just be sure to go to church for about 7 weeks, just to be safe. One more thing, do not attempt to record the ritual. You will have a huge chance of the ritual not working, or a small chance, of being torn to shreds. Do not ask who or what will tear you apart, after all, everyone has a different sin.</h4>
