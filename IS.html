<body style="color:White;">IS is an acronym for; Invisible Specter. ISs are unable to be seen by mortals, which is out of their control. They can interact with the physical world, and are sometimes able to change the temperaature. Remember, there are good ghosts and bad ghosts, and there is no way to tell which one the ghost is until it is too late.</body>
