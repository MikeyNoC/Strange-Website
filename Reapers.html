<p style="color:Grey;"><b>Balanced angels, angels of death, or more commonly known as Grim Reapers. That is right, there is more than one Grim Reaper. There has to be more than one considering how many people die these days. You may think that these are guys are responsible for the deaths in the world, but it is actually the demons that are responsible. Reapers guide souls to either Heaven or Hell, depending on who they were when they were alive. Each Reaper gets their own weapon, except for guns, bows and arrows, and spears. Most of them use farming tools as weapons, but I do not understand why scythes are used to portray them when the only thing they have in common appearance is their dark cloaks. Reapers can be male or female, despite modern belief. No one knows where or how Reapers are born, including myself. My friend theorises that Reapers are the souls of people who are too corrupt to go to Heaven and too pure to go to Hell, therefore they are given the task to guide souls. I will not make any false theories, but lets see what <b>you</b> can come up with. Hopefully we will be correct one of these days.</b></p>
