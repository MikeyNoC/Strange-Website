  <title>Corrupt</title>
</head>
<p>Corrupt angels are the type of angels that I'm more familiar with. As you know, not all angels can stay pure forever. The perfect example of this is Lucifer, who was God's right hand man. The angel was slowly corrupted by pride, and with each passing day, he started to believe that <b>he</b> should be the ruler of Heaven. God however, caught onto him, and cast him out of Heaven, and plunged him not only to Earth, but to the core. Lucifer was outraged, believing that he was cheated. He swore that he would ruin God, by corrupting all of humanity. His power then began to grow, and more people went to Hell. However, despite his efforts, people were still being allowed to Heaven, and he became more furious with each accepted soul. His power soon became known on the surface, and was later renamed as Satan, the ruler of Hell.</p>
