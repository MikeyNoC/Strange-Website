    <h2>Our world is simple; we wake up, eat, work/study, eat, work/study some more, go home, eat, and go to sleep. Some of us have found ways to pass the time, like reading, building, and playing video games. But some people pass the time by going where others don't, or studying dark topics. We don't realise it, but our world exists upon multiple worlds, and sometimes, they collide. I have managed to narrow down the amount of mysterious creatures in the world into three sections; Angels, Demons, and Ghosts. Below are links to the three pages that tell you more about these three types. Just remember, if someone says they are right, they could be wrong, and vice versa.</h2>
