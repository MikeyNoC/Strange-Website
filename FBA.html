  <body>FBA is an acronym for; Full Bodied Apparation. Full bodied apparations are ghosts that maintain their mortal shapes, either at will or forever. Some of these apparations are able to interact with the physical world. I hope to one day meet a full bodied apparation, preferably a friendly one.</body>
