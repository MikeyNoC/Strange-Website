  <h2>Demons hate God, this is a fact. Demons love chaos and despair, God give balance and peace. This is why demons despise churches, they are houses of God. They are also blessed by God, by a ritual that requires no blood. I can not reveal this ritual, but I can tell you another ritual that has the same result. In order to perform the ritual, you must be; a believer of God, older than eighteen, alive, and have never committed a crime. (Pornsites count as crimes.) You will need the following; four candles, a cross no smaller than your head, a matchbox or lighter, a friend or relative that has the same four qualities as you, a holy bible, and a hymn book. You can do this at anytime of the day, just not at nighttime, I recommend doing this when the sun is highest. Lie the cross flat on the floor, it is easier on a flat surface, and place each of the candles at the four ends. Your friend must read a passage from the bible, preferably a long one, while you light the four candles, slowly. If you rush then there is a small chance that you will burn yourself, even if you are using a lighter. If you are using matches and you burn yourself, do not panic, you can still continue. You should be done lighting the candles before your partner finishes the passage. Now let the candles burn, and melt. Do not blow the candles out, and keep all pets away from the cross. You and your partner may now continue your day, but you must check on the cross everyday. Do not clean up the wax when it gets on the floor, or you will risk interrupting the ritual. When all of the flames have gone out, you must get your partner and perform the second and final part of the ritual. Pick up the cross, and place it on the wall, wax side facing away from you. You may do this before you call your partner, but they must get there before sundown. The wax will hopefully stick to the wall, then you and your partner must sing a song from the hymn book. It can be any song, and it does not have to be perfect, because no one is perfect. When you and your partner are done singing, congratulations, you have completed the ritual. Your house is now blessed by God. Just make sure that you do not commit any crimes for the rest of your life, and remember; demons may not be able to enter your home, but they still can use people to do their work for them. Demons always find a way, they always do.</h2>
