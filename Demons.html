<body><h2>Demons are one of the main causes as to why there is so much pain and misery. Demons affect our daily lives, even when we are in the bathroom. Most demons affect us in minor ways, like when we lose our favorite toy or when the baby keeps crying when nothing physical is wrong with it. Some demons however, affect our lives on a much grander scale. These demons are called "Major Demons", and luckily there are only a few of them. Despite their low numbers, they are responsible for earthquakes, tsunamis, even wars. They are the reason why people like Hitler were born. I have managed to find three ways to protect yourself from the demons. The links to the instructions are listed below.</h2></body>
