  <h3 style="color:Tomato;">This ritual is not a ritual, it is more like a trial to see how you fare in a world of demons. Before you start the trial, you must make sure that you have no living relatives, or friends. Do not kill them, or you will be punished during the trial. Also, you must have perfect health for at least two straight years before starting the trial. To begin the trial, you must go to the subway at night time. (I am not talking about the restaurant.) You are only allowed to wear the following; a white trench coat, a white fedora, a plain white shirt, white pants, white shoes, and white socks. You can wear a belt if necessary, but make sure it is white. Do not wear any type of jewelry, and do not carry any personal items in your hands or pockets. (Braces and glasses count as jewelry, tough luck nerd.) You are only allowed to carry money for the ticket, and the ticket itself (If tickets are still being used in your time, and the spare change after the ticket is allowed.). Take the train car that is empty, if there are any. Do not sit down, this implies that you are weak, and you must never let demons know that you are weak. Once the train begins to move, you must say the following; gmygeenau hlmbcthi oh Skdu e smdm wenrehdoola. When you come to the first stop, they will enter your car. They will take on the form that is the least threatening to you (e.g. a smiling clown, a small child, an attractive woman, an old man, etc.), whatever form they take, they will be wearing all black. They will walk up to you and ask to hold your hat and coat, tell them “Yes, thank you.” anything else will insult them. They will stand next to you and hold your hand. Whatever you do, do not let go of their hand until you are off of the train. They will protect you, unless you either insult them or try to record the trial. If you attempt either of these things, then you have a 50/50 chance of them leaving you to face the demons ahead, or them killing you themselves. On the next stop, there will be a man. He will look at you for the entire ride, but do not stare back at him, he will attempt to steal your eyes if you do. On the third stop, a creature will get on board. I can not describe it, because it is impossible to describe. What I can tell you is that this creature will be your new worst fear, until you get to the fourth stop. At the fourth stop, there will be multiple figures and creatures. They will be different for each person, for me I saw a guy with a chainsaw cut through the top to the middle of his torso. His eyes and mouth moved perfectly aligned with each other, weird I know. Anyways, these creatures will not attack you, as long as you hold on to their hand, and do not let go. You will go through at least five more stops, the highest being forty-eight. After seven stops, some of the creatures and figures will get off and some other beings will get on. You will know when you have reached the final stop, when you see it. It will enter the train, look at you, and say one word, “Out.” don’t take the first step, let your protector take it. Once you are off of the train, you can let go of their hand. Do not walk away until two things happen. 1) The train doors close. 2) Your protector gives you a folded piece of paper and tells you to leave. Do not run away, this will give the impression that you are weak, and they will follow you. Keep walking until you are inside your house or apartment. Once you get there, unfold the paper, and read it. It will contain a list of instructions on how to protect yourself from a certain demon. Do not share the instructions with anyone. Not only will nobody believe you, but you will also wake up the next day on the same train with the same demons and no protector. Follow these instructions, and you might survive.</h3>
